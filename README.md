# Advanced Graph Neural Networks

This repository contains labs and practical assignments on Advanced Graph Neural Networks.

Labs:
1. [Self-supervised learning on graphs](lab01_ssl_on_graphs/lab.ipynb)

All assignments are presented as Jupyter notebooks, that can be done by writing code instead of the line
```
# YOUR CODE HERE
