# Advanced Graph Neural Networks

This repository contains labs and practical assignments on Advanced Graph Neural Networks.

Labs:
1. [Self-supervised learning on graphs](lab01_ssl_on_graphs/lab.ipynb)
2. [Subgraph embeddings](lab02_subgraph_emb/lab.ipynb)
3. [Scalable GNN](lab03_scalable_gnn/lab.ipynb)
4. [Knowledge distillation](lab04_knowledge_distillation/lab.ipynb)
5. [Deep graph generation](lab05_deep_generaion/lab.ipynb)
6. [Explainable GNN](lab06_explainable_gnn/lab.ipynb)

All assignments are presented as Jupyter notebooks, that can be done by writing code instead of the line
```
# YOUR CODE HERE
```
All notebooks contain test cells with assert statements that help you understand whether your code is correct.

Assignments:
1. [Graph contrastive learning](assignment01_contrastive_learning/assignment.ipynb)
2. [Recurrent graph generation](assignment02_recurrent_generation/assignment.ipynb)
